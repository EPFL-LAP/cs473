# [*CS-473: System programming for Systems-on-chip](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/system-programming-for-systems-on-chip-CS-473)
This repository contains the sources of the virtual prototype as used in the course cs473 System Programming for Systems-on-Chip.

The virtual prototype contains:
* virtualprototype/modules: Here all verilog modules of the virtual prototype are stored including their documentation.
* virtualprototype/programs: Here you find two example programs that can be run on the virtual prototype.
* virtualprototype/systems: Here you find the top-level of the dual-core version of the virtual prototype and the synthesis scripts.

**Important:** The CPU used in the virtual-prototype is an *OR1300*, an in house developed OpenRISC CPU.
